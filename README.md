# subtitles
Subtitles translation for technical videos (Linux, LinkIt 7688, etc). Translating from Chinese to English.

## Current Work
- YouTube Video - [[TWLKH主題] Introduction to NUMA and Hugepage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTxx68jEDXU)
  - Work on Amara - [https://amara.org/zh/videos/ynYN29YHKdfH/url/3361959/](https://amara.org/zh/videos/ynYN29YHKdfH/url/3361959/)

Porgress: 2 parts in progress, 3 parts to do 

## How to Help
If, like me,
- you are interested in the videos in current work,
- with sufficient Chinese or English skill,
- and are willing to contribute your spare time.

Here's how to get involved:
- Goto [Projects](https://github.com/vi9076/subtitles/projects/1) tab
- There are 5 boards, from left to right:
  - "To Do": Nobody works on it. Picking up a card (actually a GitHub issue) by setting the issue assignee to yourself. And move the card to "Transcription".
  - "Transcription", "Translation": Somebody already works on it, transcription means Chinese subtitle, translation means English subtitle.
  - "Review": The final stage before finish.
  - "Done": Finished work, also a closed issue. Re-open it in case of bugs.
